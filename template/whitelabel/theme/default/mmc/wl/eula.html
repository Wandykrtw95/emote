<p><strong>Last Updated</strong>: December 28, 2011</p>
<p>These Software Terms of Use ("<strong>Agreement</strong>") are a legal agreement between you (either an individual or an entity) and Emotive Communications, Inc. ("<strong>Emotive</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>our</strong>," or "<strong>us</strong>") regarding the use of the Emotive software program that you are installing on your device and the services available through the Software (together, the "<strong>Software</strong>"). </p>
<p>BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY AND ARE BECOMING A PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE. If you are using the Software on behalf of your employer, you represent that you are authorized to accept this Agreement on your employer's behalf.</p>
<p><strong>The Software</strong></p>
<p>Emotive provides a cloud-based platform for mobile access to an enterprise subscriber's business applications. The Software enables the enterprise subscriber's end users, within a single application, to access and use information from across multiple third party business applications.</p>
<p><strong>Account Information</strong></p>
<p>You must register for an account in order to use the Software. You agree that the information you provide to Emotive upon registration and at all other times will be true, accurate, current, and complete. You also agree to keep this information accurate and up-to-date at all times.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of any logins, passwords, or other credentials that you select or that are provided to you to access the Software, and for any third party applications that you access via the Software. Please notify Emotive immediately of any unauthorized use of your Emotive account or any other breach of security.</p>
<p><strong>License to Software</strong></p>
<p>Subject to your compliance with all terms and conditions in this Agreement, Emotive grants to you a personal, limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-assignable, revocable license to download, install, and use one copy of the Software, in object code form, for your internal business purposes, solely on the mobile device for which that Software was created, and, if applicable, in accordance with the Usage Rules set forth in the Apple, Inc. App Store Terms of Service. This limited license does not include any right to modify, distribute, prepare derivative works of, or grant sublicenses to use the Software. Furthermore, in order to protect the trade secrets and proprietary know-how contained in the Software, you will not decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer the Software.</p>
<p><strong>Ownership</strong></p>
<p>Except for the rights expressly granted under this Agreement, Emotive reserves all right, title, and interest in and to the Software, including all intellectual property and other proprietary rights, and no other rights are granted, either express or implied, to you. </p>
<p><strong>Data </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Software enables you to transmit to Emotive and access or store certain materials, data, and information ("<strong>Data</strong>"). You must not transmit, access, or store Data via the Software unless you have all necessary rights to do so. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For any Data that you upload, transmit, or store via the Software, you: (a) grant Emotive and our subsidiaries and affiliates a nonexclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, and fully sublicensable right to use that Data to provide the services requested by you and for Emotive's other internal business purposes; (b) represent and warrant that you have the right to grant to Emotive the license to that Data as set forth in this Agreement; and (c) represent and warrant that Emotive's&nbsp;use of the Data will not violate any rights of or cause injury to any person or entity, and will not otherwise create any harm or liability of any type for Emotive or for third parties. You remain solely responsible for any errors or omissions in the Data and any liability arising out of the Data or Emotive's failure to transmit or store Data. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Restrictions</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must, in connection with your use of the Software, comply with all applicable laws. Except as may be expressly permitted by applicable law or authorized by Emotive in writing, you will not, and will not permit anyone else to: (a) transmit, provide, or store any Data that Emotive, in our sole discretion, deems inappropriate, unlawful, harmful (including without limitation viruses, corrupted data, or other harmful or destructive files), tortious, defamatory, invasive of another's privacy, a violation of another's intellectual property or other proprietary rights, or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate; (b) use any automated tool (e.g., robots, spiders) to access the Software; (c) rent, lease, sublicense, or provide your access to the Software to another person; (d) circumvent or disable any usage rules or other security features of the Software; (e) use the Software in a manner that threatens the integrity, performance, or availability of the Software; or (f) destroy, remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary markings or notices (including copyright, trade secret, trademark, and patent notices) on or contained in any portion of the Software. &nbsp;</p>
