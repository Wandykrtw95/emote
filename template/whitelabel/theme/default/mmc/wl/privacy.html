<p class="p1"><b>Emotive Communications, Inc.</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p class="p2"><b>Last Updated: </b>December 28, 2011</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</b></p>
<p class="p2">The Emotive website and services made available from www.Emotive.com or otherwise by Emotive, including our applications, are owned and operated by Emotive Communications, Inc. ("<b>Emotive</b>," "<b>we</b>," "<b>our</b>," or "<b>us</b>"). At Emotive, we understand that you value your privacy, and we want to help make your experience with our site and other services (referred to in this policy collectively as our "<b>Service</b>") satisfying and safe. This policy describes our collection of information, including personal information, in connection with our Service and explains how we use and disclose this information.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Personal Information</b></p>
<p class="p2">"<b>Personal information</b>," as used in this policy, is information that may be used to identify an individual, such as a person's name, address, email address, or credit card.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>How We Collect Personal Information</b></p>
<p class="p2">We collect personal information in the course of providing our Service to you, including through your voluntary, optional submissions, such as information that you provide to us at the time of registering for our Service, or through your use of our Service. When you register with us for an account, we may collect information such as your name, address, email address, and telephone. When you use our Service from your mobile device, we may collect information such as your IP address, telephone network provider, and location. You may also provide personal information to us in other ways, such as by requesting user support.</p>
<p class="p2">We may receive personal information from third parties about their users and may combine this information with other personal information we maintain about you. If we do so, this policy also governs the combined information.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>How We Use Personal Information</b></p>
<p class="p2">We use personal information we collect to provide, improve, and develop our Service, to tailor your user experience, to respond to your inquiries or requests, to prevent or investigate fraudulent or inappropriate usage of our Service, for research and development, to analyze trends, and for the other purposes described in this policy.</p>
<p class="p2">In addition, we may use your personal information to deliver targeted marketing messages, including notifying you of software updates. You may opt-out from receiving these messages by following the instructions provided in the messages or by emailing the address provided at the end of this policy.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>How We Share Personal Information</b> <span class="s1"><br>
</span>In the course of providing the Service, we may share your personal information with third-party service providers, including providing your access credentials for a third-party business application to the provider of that business application. We may also provide personal information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, and other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of providing our Service, including using your access credentials to log on to third-party applications, and for our other purposes described in this policy. We limit the personal information shared with these third parties to that which is necessary to carry out those functions. <span class="s1"><br>
</span>We may share personal information with third parties (including regulatory or law enforcement authorities) in order to carry out a user's request or if we believe that doing so is legally required or is in our interest to protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights or property of others. <span class="s1"><br>
</span><b>If you post any of your information to any public area of our Service, please be aware that it is no longer "personal information" for the purposes of this policy, and we or anyone else may use such information without restriction. If you provide access to personal or other information, including your email address or name, to other users through any of our Service settings or functionality, please understand that Emotive has no control over how others may collect, use, or disclose such information. </b><span class="s1"><br>
</span><b>Non-Personal Information We Collect, and How We Use It </b><span class="s1"><br>
</span>We may also collect information that is not personally identifiable, and may aggregate personal information or otherwise render it anonymous (that is, non-personally identifiable). We may use non-personally identifiable information we collect to provide, improve, and develop our Service and otherwise to tailor your user experience, to prevent or investigate fraudulent or inappropriate usage of our Service, for research and development, and for the other purposes described in this policy. We may use this anonymous information for various purposes and may share it with third parties. Below are some examples of the types of non-personal information we collect and some specific examples of how we use this information:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b><i>Usage tracking</i>.</b> We may collect non-personal information from your use of our Service. For example, we may collect information about user traffic and usage patterns throughout our site, and similar information regarding the use of our Service. We may also track click-through information, such as IP addresses, from the messages we send to our users. We use the information we collect in these manners to, for example, improve our Service, to develop new products and services, to discourage and address abusive and fraudulent use of our Service, and to help our users with troubleshooting issues.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b><i>Methods of collection</i>.</b> We collect non-personal information passively using technologies such as standard server logs, cookies, and clear GIFs (also known as "Web beacons"). When you visit our site or use our Service, we may send one or more cookies - a small file containing a string of characters - to your computer, mobile device, tablet, or similar device that uniquely identifies your browser or recognizes a cookie that is already on your device. We use cookies to improve the quality of our Service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends, and to customize your experience. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. Also, please be aware that third parties may set cookies on your hard drive or use other means of passively collecting information about your use of their services or content. We do not have access to, or control over, these third-party means of passive data collection.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">If we directly combine any non-personal information gathered through passive means with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information under this policy. Otherwise, we use information collected by passive means in aggregated or other non-personally identifiable forms.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Our Commitment to Data Security</b></p>
<p class="p2">In an effort to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Please be aware, however, that no data transmissions over the Internet or other networks can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or integrity of any information you transmit to us. You transmit information to us at your own risk. Once we receive personal information, we make reasonable efforts to protect it from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. But we cannot represent or guarantee that personal information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.</p>
<p class="p2">If Emotive learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Emotive may post a notice through the Service if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to access the Service. Emotive may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Third-Party Sites and Services</b></p>
<p class="p2">Our Service may contain links to and interoperate with third-party sites and services. Any links to or interoperability with third-party sites or services are provided for your convenience only, and we do not have control over the content or privacy and security practices and policies of such third parties. Any personal information that you provide to any other third party is subject to that third party's privacy practices and policies, not this policy. We encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices and policies before providing them with personal information.</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Business Transfers</b> <span class="s1"><br>
</span>Information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, or similar transaction, as well as in the unlikely event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which personal information would be transferred as one of our business assets.<span class="s1"><br>
</span><b>International Visitors  </b><span class="s1"><br>
</span>The Service is hosted in and provided from the United States. If you use our Service from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring your personal data to the United States. The United States does not have the same data protection laws as the EU and some other regions. By providing your personal information, you consent to the transfer of your personal data to the United States and the use of your personal information in accordance with this policy. <span class="s1"><br>
</span><b>Information Retention and Disposal</b><span class="s1"><br>
</span>We may retain personal information for as long as we have a business need for it or as applicable laws or regulations or government orders require us to retain it. Additionally, the Service may enable you (or other users) to save information, including information that you have made public or allowed certain users to access or see. <span class="s1"><br>
</span><b>Changes and Updates</b><span class="s1"><br>
</span>We may occasionally update this policy. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. <span class="s1"><br>
